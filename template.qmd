## About Me

- 👩‍🎓 PhD Candidate in Monash EBS
- Researching principles and methods for "alternative" data
  - conceptual and practical data provenance tools for harmonised multi-source datasets
  - adapting web-scraped retail product & price data for public health research

 - Managing scientific risk with web scraping
            - **time/cost (10min):** tech/tools overview, data collection vs. cleaning (@)
            - **quality (30min):** bias/variance, sampling issues (@foerdererShouldWeTrust2023), observational vs. analysis resolution (@mengStatisticalParadisesParadoxes2018)
            - **ethics/legal (10min):** example journal policies [AEA Data](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/data-legality-policy), robots.txt, website T&Cs,

## Overview

- scoping -> what not how
- Web-scraping and web-scraped data (slides from EBS evening)
  - VERB: data collection method, and post-processing methods
  - NOUN: common properties of data collected via web-scraping
    - messy by definition
  - not just getting --> what do with it/things to know about it
- Preparing to collect
  - web-scraping both highlights & obscures the fuzziness of what a dataset *is*
  - defining your target population & dataset -- closed sets vs. open sets
    - conceptually closed, operationally open (stock prices)
    - operationally closed, conceptually open (webpages)
  - ethical & legal considerations -- low legal risk, but journal/publication risk --> CHECK journal policies
- Resourcing web-scraping projects
  - harvesting static pages, interactive retrieval of dynamically loaded pages, API queries & hidden info
  - structured vs unstructured data <--> database/analysis vs. display/present
  - consider industry data partner
    - billion prices project
    - alcohol prices (SG concept diagram)
- Analysing web-scraped data --> hand over to Patrick

## Alternative data & web-scraping

- "alternative" is:
    - datasets that are not properly randomised experiment/survey samples and population census
